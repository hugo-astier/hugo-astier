## Hello, I'm Hugo 👋

🔭 I craft web apps.

JS is my daily cup of tea but whichever the language, X or Y framework... At the core it's all the same: DS & Algos.<br>
What only matters is the right tool for the task at hand 💪

♥ : When I'm not hacking I'm usually in the mountains rock-climbing, summiting, or trail-running 🏔️ 

Currently located in Marseille, France, enjoying sunshine almost every day ☀️  but enjoying collaborating in english 🇬🇧 

Feel free to get in touch!
