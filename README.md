## Hello, I'm Hugo 👋

🔭 I craft web apps.

JS is my daily cup of tea but whatever the language, or framework, at the core it's the same good olds DS & Algos.<br>
What only matters is the right tool for the task at hand 💪

♥ : When I'm not hacking I'm usually in the mountains rock-climbing, summiting, or trail-running 🏔️ 

Currently located in Marseille, France, enjoying sunshine every day ☀️

Feel free to get in touch!
